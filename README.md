**Something about me:** <br>

As a data scientist at Zymo Research, I am passionate about leveraging my microbiome research, Python, and R expertise to drive impactful data-driven solutions. With a strong background in microbiome research, I bring a deep understanding of microbial ecology and the intricate interactions within complex microbial communities.

My proficiency in Python allows me to develop robust and scalable data analysis pipelines, implement machine learning algorithms, and perform statistical analyses to uncover meaningful insights from microbiome data. I have experience working with diverse types of microbiome data, including 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics. In addition to my technical skills, I have a keen eye for data visualization and storytelling. I excel in creating visually appealing and informative visualizations using tools like ggplot2, and Adobe Illustrator, effectively communicating complex findings to technical and non-technical audiences. I am always eager to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in microbiome research. <br>
